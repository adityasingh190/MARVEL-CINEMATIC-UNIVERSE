	<p><b>"Okay, look, the city is flying, we're fighting an army of robots... and I have a bow and arrow. None of this makes sense. But I'm going back out there because it's my job."</b><br>
―Hawkeye to Scarlet Witch[src]<br>
Clinton Francis "Clint" Barton, also known as Hawkeye, is a skilled marksman, a former special agent of S.H.I.E.L.D. and one of the founding members of the Avengers. <br>Known for his use of the bow and arrow as his primary weapon, Barton had become one of the best agents of S.H.I.E.L.D., responsible<br> for the recruitment of Black Widow, whom he developed a strong friendship with. Assigned by Nick Fury into watching over the Tesseract,<br> he was brainwashed by Loki and used as his pawn for all his evil schemes. However, following their Attack on the Helicarrier,<br> he was freed from Loki's mental controls by Black Widow and joined the Avengers to fight against Loki's Chitauri army in the Battle of<br> New York, ending Loki's Invasion, before Hawkeye had returned to his work as a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent.

Hawkeye continued to work with S.H.I.E.L.D. until its collapse following the HYDRA Uprising, he and the Avengers worked to bring down the remnants of HYDRA, eventually capturing<br> Wolfgang von Strucker and ending the organization's threat to the world. However, Hawkeye was pulled back into their fight as<br> Tony Stark had inadvertently used HYDRA as well as some Chitauri technology to create Ultron. As Ultron tried to destroy their <br>world, he allied himself with Pietro and Wanda Maximoff and Barton focused much of his efforts in convincing them to change sides while <br>keeping all the Avengers safe by bringing them into his family home. During the final Battle of Sokovia, Hawkeye's life was saved<br> by Quicksilver's sacrifice, resulting in Barton retiring from the Avengers to return to his family.

Despite living happily within retirement for a brief time, Barton was recruited by Captain America to help him during his fight against these newly produced Sokovia Accords, which forced<br> Rogers to protect his friend Bucky Barnes from being arrested for a crime he did not commit. Feeling that he owed a debt to<br> Rogers and Maximoff, Hawkeye had joined in the Clash of the Avengers, fighting against Iron Man who was in support of the Accords.<br> Despite putting up a good fight, Hawkeye and most of their team were eventually defeated and imprisoned at the Raft under<br> the order from Thaddeus Ross, only to be freed by Rogers. Barton returned back to retirement and, after<br> striking his deal with Ross, was then placed under his house arrest.

In the wake of the Snap, Barton then went onto a grief-fuelled rampage against criminals for five years as a vigilante named Rōnin. Having been found by Black Widow,<br> Barton was then convinced to return to the Avengers to attempt to reverse the Snap. Hawkeye joined the team in enacting the Time<br> Heist in order to obtain the Infinity Stones, during which he witnessed Romanoff sacrifice her life so Hawkeye could reclaim the Soul Stone.<br> However, as the Avengers had succeeded in their goal, they were ambushed by Thanos, with Hawkeye being ordered to ensure Thanos could<br> not get the Nano Gauntlet. Eventually, Thanos and his entire army were defeated, as Tony Stark had sacrificed his life,<br> allowing Barton to then return home with his beloved family, while he still mourned Romanoff's death.</p>
